<!-- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA W/ ADDED PSEUDOCODE
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    COMPLETE! Add a button to the page
    COMPLETE! Add an eventlistener for the click to activate
    COMPLETE! Add a timer to the page (use some sort of decrement)
    COMPLETE! Link the timer to the click
    COMPLETE! Have a question rendered to the page dynamically
        COMPLETE! Create a question bank
        COMPLETE! Make a random order to render them one at a time
    COMPLETE! Have answer choices rendered to the page
        COMPLETE! Create an answer bank
        COMPLETE! Make a random order to render them four at a time

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
    7. Allow each answer to be clickable
    8. Right or wrong, answering will remove that question and open a new one

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    9. When choice !== answer, decrement clock further

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
    10. When questionsremaining = 0 || time = 0, game over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score 
    11. Score will have to be logged to local memory
    12. Scoreboard will have to render the tops upon entering
    13. Final scoreboard must receive name input

NEW ISSUES:
    1. Clicking START again will mess up the timer.
    2. Questions will likely repeat throughout quiz.
        Possibly add a usedQuestions array to push used q's to?
    3. Answers can repeat for the same question
